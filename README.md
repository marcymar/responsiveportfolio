# Welcome to my responsive porfolio page!

###### This was a challenging project, but I think the results were worth it! 

## Here's a direct link to [My portfolio](https://marcymar.github.io/responsiveportfolio/).

My favorite aspect of the webpage is the Navbar, like the other elements on the page I utilized **Bootstrap.**  Of course I also used **HTML** and some **CSS** elements for formatting.  

The margins on either side of each element stays the same as you switch views! 
> The margins defintely gave me the most trouble.
